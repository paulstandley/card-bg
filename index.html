      <p class="para">The gray wolf,also known as the timber wolf or western wolf.</p>
      <ol class="list_items">
      <li><strong>Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white</strong></li>
      <li><strong>The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few</em></p>
